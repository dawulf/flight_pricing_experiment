##Study summary
###My study attempts to measure the effect of repeated flight price checking on the change in those prices over time.

##Scope, adjusted from proposal
In order to keep the study manageable, I have decided on the following. All flights will be limited to the basic fares of nonstop routes run by United, Delta, and American Airlines. The airports will be picked from a geographically dispersed list: SEA, SFO, LAX, DEN, DFW, ORD, ATL, BOS, and LGA. All of these airports are hubs of at least one of the three airlines of interest, and have traffic from all three. The times considered will be between 7am and 3pm on Wednesday, February 12th and Wednesday, February 19th, far enough away so that flights will not likely sell out. The websites used will be (and will be blocked on) official airline websites, as well as three independent travel sites (Expedia, Booking, and TripAdvisor).
